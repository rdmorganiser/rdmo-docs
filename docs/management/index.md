# Management

RDMO has an intricate content management system that allows users to customize and create content inside the [RDMO web interface](user-interface). The content itself determines the main usage of this web service and is described in the [data model](data-model), [views and their template syntax](views), and [export and import](export) sections. In projects, users can assign roles to each other. The different roles are described in the [roles](roles) section.
